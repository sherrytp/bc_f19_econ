## Unit objectives

  1. To obtain an understanding of common statistical methods used in business and economic forecasting.
  2. To develop the computer skills required to forecast business and economic time series data;
  3. To gain insights into the problems of implementing and operating large scale forecasting systems for use in business.

### Teaching and learning approach

Two 50 minute classes and a one 80 minute computer lab session each week for 12 weeks.
